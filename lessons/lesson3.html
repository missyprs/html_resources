  <h1>Images on Webpages</h1>
  <p>
    To make a website look better, and also to follow what our clients want, we
    use images
  </p>
  <img src="horse.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" />
  <!--this image is too big though (｡•́︿•̀｡) -->
  <!-- so we will change the size to be half the size using width="50%" height="50%" -->
  <!-- we can also use specific sizes like width="200" height="300"-->
  <!-- but what does the 50% do?  What happens if we use width="100%" height="100%" instead? 
  what happens when we then change the size of our browser to make it smaller-->
</body>

<!--exercise for the day, get them to add an image to a webpage and resize it so that it takes up 30% of the page-->
