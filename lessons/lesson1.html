<body>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>This is the first example of HTML coding</p>
  <p>
    HTML is a Hyper Text Markup Language, not a programming language. This means
    that it just changes the way that the text and other content looks on the
    page
  </p>
  <p>
    By using right click and then "view page source" we can see what this page
    actually looks like in html
  </p>
  <!-- A lot different to how it appears on screen-->
</body>
